	<p class="aboutHistory">
		Ramen was traditionally a Chinese dish that migrated to Japan during the 19th century. Initially referred to as "shina soba," which roughly translates to "noodle dish." It was made on food carts and sold to the poor and working classes as a cheap meal. It was only until the 1950s that the name "ramen" was adopted. After several recreations and growing populatiry, its status shifted to a popular gourmet meal that was a must-have for visitors. While still broad and without complete certainty, it can be said that ramen was initially a Chinese meal that became refined and popularized in Japan.

How long and thin the noodles are depends on how many times the dough is put thorugh this proces. Also included in this class is guidance on how to prep and combine various vegetables, meats and sauces for the optimal ramen experience.
